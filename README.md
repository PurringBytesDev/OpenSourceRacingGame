# OpenSourceRacingGame
an open source racing game based on youtube tutorials i do

You will find the current / in progress of the tutorials (up to date)
in the branch "main".

Each part of the tutorial will be found in their separate branch.

So far, part 1 is available; this will be updated along the way
(therefore, the up-to-date readme is always in the main branch).
